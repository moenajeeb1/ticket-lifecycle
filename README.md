From the agent panel, agents can view all the tickets created by the users or customers. SLAs will be assigned properly according to the right appropriate time frame to close the ticket and tickets will be assigned to the right agents.

The priority level on this ticket is not high but is normal due to the fact that is most likely a easy problem to fix and is not detrimental like a business impacting event. The priority has been set to normal. We have set the SLA plan accordingly and gave the ticket to John Doe, our go to guy to fix problems like this. In other ticketing systems customers can set their own SLA plans. Help desk professionals sometimes have to downgrade the SLA plan the customer put because it is not as detrimental or impacting as they say it is.
